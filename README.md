# Counting Cows
*Count the number of cows after 'n' years. We start with 1 cow, and we know that:*

*- Each cow gives birth to one calf every year;*

*- A calf grows into a cow after 2 years;*

*- Cows and calves never die.*

## HOW TO USE
Just run the *counting_cows.py* file and change the input on the *'count.get_total(n)'* for the number of years that you want.
